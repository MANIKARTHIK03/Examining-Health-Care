Introduction:
The project aims to analyse the health insurance status and healthcare behaviour of individuals
based on a dataset containing responses to various health-related questions. Understanding
people's access to health insurance, their habits around routine checkups, and the frequency of
cancer screenings can provide insights into healthcare accessibility and trends in preventive care.
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
1. Explore Insurance Coverage: Determine how many people are insured and analyse the
distribution of insurance providers among insured individuals.
2. Clean and Preprocess Data: Handle missing values and clean textual data by removing
special characters and unwanted whitespaces to ensure accuracy in analysis.
3. Visualize Key Findings: Use statistical methods and visualizations such as bar plots and
pie charts to gain insights into the distribution of health insurance coverage and the most
common insurance companies.
Analysing statistical numerical features such as the number of individuals with insurance and
their choice of insurance providers is crucial for identifying key healthcare trends. For
instance, understanding how many people visit hospitals regularly and undergo routine
checkups or cancer screenings can inform public health policy, insurance providers, and
healthcare accessibility.
Relevance of the Dataset:
This dataset is highly relevant for addressing questions related to healthcare access and
utilization. By exploring the patterns of insurance coverage, routine medical visits, and
cancer screenings, the analysis sheds light on how insured and uninsured individuals navigate
healthcare. This information can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of insurance policies,
improve healthcare services, and address gaps in coverage.
The insights gained from the visualizations highlight the overall state of health insurance
coverage and its impact on individualsâ€™ healthcare behaviour, contributing to discussions on
healthcare reform and policy improvements.
